# Fruit Video Recognition

This project is a WIP designed to recognize certain types of fruits in video frames using OpenCV and some other Computer Vision/Machine Learning API.
The API and the dataset used to train the Machine Learning model have yet to be chosen.

In the future, this program is planned to have a dedicated GUI for users.

Further details will be announced soon.
