# Fruit Video Recognition

This project is a WIP designed to recognize certain types of fruits in video frames using OpenCV and some other Computer Vision/Machine Learning API.
The API and the dataset used to train the Machine Learning model have yet to be chosen.

## main.py

Main function. Assembles the other files together.

## user_interface.py

Contains all the functions that manipulate the GUI directly.

## video_capture.py

Contains the basic functions for video file and frames manipulation, discounting the machine learning model

## fruit_cv_model.py

Handles the creation (training, validation and testing) and deployment of the machine learning model to be used by the other files.
Will probably be using PyTorch but not sure at the moment.
